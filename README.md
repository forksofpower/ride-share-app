Welcome to the Gig Economy Simulator! The Gig Economy Simulator is a game in which you're a rideshare driver trying to make as much money as possible before your day is over.

Be careful, though--other money-hungry drivers have been let loose on the grid, too! Move around on the grid to pick up a passenger, drop that passenger off at their desired destination, and make some money!

Instructions:
The game will ask you to log in or sign up with an email.
Upon starting the game, you'll have already picked up a passenger who is impatiently waiting for you to drive them to their destination. Driver AIs are battling you to make the most money. The day ends when you or one of the other drivers finishes 10 rides. Money will be counted Good luck!


Stretch goals:
-Show the grid!
-Player/User can move their vehicle themselves to traverse across the grid.
-Player/User can move outside of an initiated ride to find a passenger.
-Change the money system so that money is lost everytime you make an unnecessary move/turn.
-Tips & cleanliness! Cleanliness of the car can affect the tip collected and the rating given by the passenger. Tips can also be affected by how many turns it takes you to reach your destination.
-Cleanliness can be fixed at certain locations on the map (car washes!)
-Gas! If you run out of gas during a ride, you lose your passenger and have to pay an overwhelming amount of money to be towed and have your gas refilled. Refill your gas at a randomly-generated gas station for an amount of money directly tied to the amount of gas you need to fill up. (If you don't have enough money for gas, you will go into negative monies.)
